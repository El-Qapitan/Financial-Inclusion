    "The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm or KNN for short is a very simple technique.\n",

    "The entire training dataset is stored. When a prediction is required, the k-most similar records to a new record from the training dataset are then located. From these neighbors, a summarized prediction is made.\n",

    "Similarity between records can be measured many different ways. A problem or data-specific method can be used. Generally, with tabular data, a good starting point is the Euclidean distance.\n",
